function [logit_x] = logit(x)

% 
% function to transform proportional data to normalize it for statistical analysis such as regressions
% the input data x must be proportions with values between 0-1
% where logit(x) = log(x/(1-x)) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit)
%
% This function uses an epsilon method to truncate the proportion data if there are occurrences of 0 and/or 1 values
% where epsilon is half of the lowest non-zero value of x 
% (if there are 0 values but not 1 values)
% or epsilon is half of the difference between 1 and the highest non-one value of x 
% (if there are 1 values but not 0 values)
% or the min of half of the lowest non-zero value of x and half of the difference between 1 and the highest non-one value of x 
% (if there are 0 and 1 values but not 0 values)
% and epsilon is substituted for the zero values and 1-epsilon is substituted for the 1 values 
% to truncate and maintain symmetry and shape of the logit distribution.

% This function uses the following two other custom matlab functions by Jan Gl√§scher:
% - nanmin2 find the minimum value from a vector or array that may contain nan values
% - nanmax2 find the maximum value from a vector or array that may contain nan values
